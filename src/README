This daemon uses less than 1% of the RPi CPU.
It polls and debounces the configured GPIO inputs,
and emits uinput events to simulate the keyboard.
Each GPIO contact can emit a sequence of keyboard characters.
Configuration is stored in either ~/.pikeyd165.conf or /etc/pikeyd165.conf

Usage: pikeyd [option]

Options:
  -d    run as daemon
  -k    try to terminate running daemon
  -v    version
  -smi  skip mouse initialisation, no mouse/trackball devices are created
  -ndb  no key debounce
  -h    this help
